*Motivation*. Validating energy system models is crucial for ensuring their accuracy and reliability. However, this process can be time-consuming and complex, often requiring extensive manual effort to compare model outputs with real-world data. PyPSA-Earth-Status addresses this challenge by providing an automated framework for validating energy networks against established energy system statistics, also maintaining up-to-date statistics on the accuracy of PyPSA-Earth.
